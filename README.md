# Graduation
### This repository contains all the related data and codes I worked on for my undergrad final graduation thesis.

· Briefly describe the problems existing in the field of road traffic management in China from the past to the present day and the significance of applying intelligent traffic management technology and management methods. Introduce the relevant basic theories and technologies and combs through its development history. Explain the main research content of this thesis, the experimental work, and the arrangement of each chapter.

· Elaborate the theoretical knowledge and technical introduction of convolutional neural network algorithm models and other related topics. Give a brief explanation of the concept of convolutional neural networks, common threshold functions used in model applications, learning and training algorithms, image convolution principles, and relevant performance evaluation indicators for models.

· Build the machine learning Random Forest and SVM algorithm models for car license plate recognition detection using Scikit-Learn. The steps include image data preprocessing, model building, setting model parameters, completing the training of the model, test sets testing, and outputting the corresponding performance evaluation indexes.

· Complete the construction of the convolutional neural network car license plate recognition model using Pytorch, complete the iterative training of the model, and test the model generated after training on test datasets, generate visual test results and analyze them. Meanwhile, make innovative improvements to address the limitations and deficiencies of the current convolutional neural network model. Improve the performance of the model and pursue better model recognition and detection results. For example, using the Softmax function to probabilistically generate outputs and setting threshold conditions to make the model's recognition criteria clear.

· Make brief summaries of the thesis's research work and findings obtained. Make further outlook on the subsequent related research work on convolutional neural network models, such as optimization, iteration, etc.
